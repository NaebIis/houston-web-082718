## Why Michael highly recommends using Redux for your project

1. It is really helpful and useful for certain kinds of apps. Redux devtools is awesome.

2. It's probably the most widely used state management library out there, so many employers use it. It's actually included in some job descriptions. React Native and GraphQL (and Angular...) are two others I've seen.

3. It's a great buzzword to add to your resume because it demonstrates that you're not an amateur just playing around with React. You've actually thought through building an app that scales.

4. The most important part of your job application is probably the biggest project you've worked on, which will be your mod 5 project. Having a solid React/Redux project will help you stand out as someone who understands the basic principles of building a scalable app, and will allow you to talk about it with interviewers.

5. Try to think of an app idea in which Redux would be useful as it scales (a large feature list, lots of things in state that interact with one another, etc.).
